# Stack-overflow-tags-analysis

## You are provided with a data file that contains tags given to resources on a social media site. The data contains three columns:
```
source: A tag
target: Another tag that has been assigned to the same resource as that tagged by the source tag
value: a measure of the co-occurrence of the tags
```
## Your task is to use your learnings in Graph Analysis to find:
```
the most important tags in defining the domains that the resources belong to
different communities of tags
cluster the tags
propose a method for recommending tags to a user that is tagging a resource with one of more existing tags
```
